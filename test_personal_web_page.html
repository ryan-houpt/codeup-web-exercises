    <h3 style="text-align:center;">I am a travel buff</h3>
    <p>If you can't tell pretty quickly I am a huge fan of travel. My dream is to one day find a position where I can travel more extensively than I have in the past to learn more about the worlds cultures and populations.
    Who doesn't love a nice leisurely stroll on the beach from time to time as well?</p>

        <p>So far, my travel book is not nearly as extensive as I'd like. But my hope is that if I can find the right homw, that can change dramatically!
            For now my travel book includes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>California</b> - I worked at Disneyland for a small stint while living here</li>
            <li><b>Washington State</b> - Climbed mt rainer on my visit!</li>
            <li><b>Florida</b> - Been to disneyworld half a dozen times, and had a great time at an "Ice" bar.</li>
            <li><b>France</b> - Got some of the best nighttime pictures I've ever taken of the eiffel tower lit up at night here</li>
            <li><b>Italy</b> - Best pizza I have ever had. Hands down.</li>
            <li><b>Spain</b> - Was almost pickpocketed on one of Barcelona's main streets and had some amazing views of the La Sagrada Familia church</li>
            <li><b>Canada</b> - Went to an old olympic village. Unfortunately was not snowing at the time, so no chance to ski</li>

        <p>I am looking for a work environment that allows me to have a great work/life balance. While money is an important factor, it is
        easily at the bottom of my list of importance. I would trade a larger salary for time to travel and spend with my family any day.
        I love interacting with and meeting new people, and I'm not afraid to have discussions/present in large groups, in fact I flourish in
        that environment. My dream job would include the following;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remote eligible from time to time</li>
            <li>Great work/life balance</li>
            <li>Creativity encouraged</li>
            <li>Openness to alternative opinions</li>
            <li>Active office community/events</li>
        </ul>
